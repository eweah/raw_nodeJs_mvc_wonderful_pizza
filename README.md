# Pure NodeJs MVC
### [Wonderful Pizza: America's Most Wanted Pizza](https://wonderfulpizza.ericsonweah.dev/menu "Wonderful Piza Menu")
I wanted to relearn the basics (HTML, CSS, Javascript,and NodeJs) so I decided to build
a website or web application for some fictional pizza delivery company I called Wonderful Pizza: America's Most Wanted Pizzas. I had one single rule in mind when building this personal project. And the number one rule is: No npm, no dependencies, no frameworks, no libraries,no CDNs, no copying and pasting someone else's codes, and certainly no package.json. So the whole project was built from scratch, from an empty folder. The basis of the project are:
1. Front End: vanilla HTML, vanilla CSS, and vanilla Javascript. No npm, no dependencies, no package.json, no frameworks, no libraries, and no CDNs.
2. Back End: vanilla JavaScript and pure NodeJs: No npm, no dependencies, no package.json, no frameworks, and no libraries


### Composition
#### Front End
1. CSS, CSS-Grid
2. Javascript
3. Web Component
#### Back End: API
1. Token based
2. Routing
#### Back End: CLI
1. authentication
2. Administration
### Some Functionalities
registration, authentication, authorization, email notifications, text notifications, emailing, texting, shopping cart, ordering, credit and debit card payments and charges, placing order, reviewing order, updating carts, updating cart items, order records (receipt), account update, etc. 
### Notes: 
This project uses Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP) heavily. By Object Oriented Programming I mean Object Oriented Programming the Javascript way and specifically the ES6 way. And by Functional Programming I mean functional programming the Javascript way; specifically the ES6 way.

All the front end codes and all the classes of the front end codes inherit a single class or interface: 
```javascript
HTMLElement
```
All the backend codes and all the classes of the backend code inherit a single NodeJs API class:

```javascript
 EventEmitter
```
### installation
1. clone the repository:
 ```javascript
 git clone https://github.com/devoutprogrammer/raw_nodeJs_mvc_wonderful_pizza.git mvc
```
or 
  ```javascript
 gh repo clone devoutprogrammer/raw_nodeJs_mvc_wonderful_pizza mvc
 ```
  Note: to use the command ```gh repo clone devoutprogrammer/raw_nodeJs_mvc_wonderful_pizza mvc``` you must have  Github CLI ```gh ``` installed on your system.
 
2. cd in the directory:
```javascript
cd mvc
```

3. switch to dev branch:
```javascript
 git checkout dev
```

3. run the command:
```javascript
 node index
```
4. Admin CLI:

 After successfully runing the command ```node index``` or ```node index.js``` in step 3, the CLI will be available with instructions.
